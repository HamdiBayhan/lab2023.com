### 4. Prototype

In web design prototype digital files are known as mockup or wireframe, this are a preview without details of what should be a final result, this process save a lot of time in design projects, we prevent future failures keeping a constant dialog with the customer about design progress. we save more time doing this process digital with tools like [Balsamiq](http://lab2023.com/balsamiq-uygulamasi-ile-web-arayuzu-tasarimi.html).
